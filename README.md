# LGS_LED
The Logitech Gaming LED SDK enables applications such as games to control the backlight LEDs on supported Logitech gaming mice and keyboards.

The user has the option to block games from changing the lighting via a setting in the Logitech Gaming Software (version 8.35 and newer). This option is located under the General settings tab of Logitech Gaming Software.

The SDK is a Windows based API for C/C++ programmers. Games based on the Microsoft Win32 API do not access hardware directly. Instead, the Logitech Gaming LED SDK interacts with supported Logitech devices on behalf of the games.

Logitech Gaming Software 8.55+ is required to enable this SDK’s features.

# SDK Package
The following files are included:

● LogitechLEDLib.h: C/C++ header file containing function prototypes

● LogitechLEDLib.lib: companion lib file to access DLL exported functions (32 and 64 bit)

# Requirements
The Logitech Gaming LED SDK can be used on the following platforms:

● Windows XP SP2 (32-bit and 64-bit)

● Windows Vista (32-bit and 64-bit)

● Windows 7 (32-bit and 64-bit)

● Windows 8 (32-bit and 64-bit)

The Logitech Gaming LED SDK is a C based interface and is designed for use by C/C++ programmers. Familiarity with Windows programming is required.
